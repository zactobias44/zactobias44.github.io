## 6/28/24 More RNA extractions

Pestles finally came in yesterday, so did more RNA extractions today. NOw I have finished all of the gill from Texada/Nelson. B/c we want to do 240 samples per NovaSeq X run, I am going to continue 
with the Vancouver Island gills. Start those next week.

More thinking about mitonuclear interactions. Met with Diana today to discuss. Caitlin has a whole database of WGS sequences from publicly available sources. Could be useful for looking at 
biogeography of the TNP/ENA haplotypes, sort of as a preliminary thing. We also have a bunch of fish we have sequenced. We could start looking for associations between nuclear loci and mitotype. 
This has been done with RADseq, but not with WGS. Talk to David and Caitlin about this next week.

Minor emergency in the fish room. A few dead baby fish. Ammonia levels too high. Going to do a water exchange and add the ammonia and pH cards into the tanks that don't have them.

Okay all for this week.
