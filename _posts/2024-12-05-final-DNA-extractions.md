## 12/5/24 Final DNA extractions (hopefully)

Finishing up the Vancouver Island DNA extractions. Last 25 and then an additional 7 rextractions. Went well. In fridge, will Qubit tomorrow. 

Also Qubitted the extracted DNA that Dolph's lab sent us. Mostly good. Will include in a sequencing run. It's 36 samples. 

Otherwise just planned my schedule for doing the library preps and updated the master sheet.
