## 8/19/24 Using the robot at JCVI

I grabbed the samples, kit, water, and some tubes and brought over to Ariel's work at JCVI. He's formating the normalization files to be compatible with the robot.

If everything goes to plan, we will normalize the four plates, transfer 7 ul to the 384 well plate, add the enzyme and buffer, incubate for first strand synthesis, and then pool into six pools of 64 
each. Probably won't happen in one day. Hopefully can come back tomorrow or Wednesday, because I leave to Colorado on Thursday.
