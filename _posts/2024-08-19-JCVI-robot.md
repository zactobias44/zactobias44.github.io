## 8/19/24 Using the robot at JCVI

I grabbed the samples, kit, water, and some tubes and brought over to Ariel's work at JCVI. He's formating the normalization files to be compatible with the robot.

If everything goes to plan, we will normalize the four plates, transfer 7 ul to the 384 well plate, add the enzyme and buffer, incubate for first strand synthesis, and then pool into six pools of 64 
each. Probably won't happen in one day. Hopefully can come back tomorrow or Wednesday, because I leave to Colorado on Thursday. 

Okay so it was a pretty long day of making programs, testing the, and running them. Everything pretty much went without a hitch, with one exception. When I was making the MM for the first strand 
synthesis, it says to mix 169ul of enzyme (FSE) with 1100ul of buffer (FSB). The tube of buffer says 1100ul on it, so I just transfered 169ul of enzyme to this tube and then mixed. But when I was 
aliquoting into a column of a 96 well plate for multichannel dispensing into the 384 RT plate, there was A LOT left over. So clearly there was more than 1100ul in the tube. Should have made in a 
separate tube, but oh well. So what I did was put the aliquots back in the tube, take leftover enzyme (there as supposed to be just 1 ul but there was at least 10-15ul), and mix to boost the 
concentration of enzyme to around what it should have been. A little sloppy, but that's what happened. Even after dispensing out the 3ul of MM to each well there was more than I anticipated left 
in the column wells, so hopefully it didn't under dispense...

We got as far as doing the incubation for FSS. Left it in the thermocycler and Hong was gonna take it out and put in the 4 C. Will continue on Wednesday beccause Ariel is out tomorrow. Manual says 
to leave at 4 C overnight, but two nights should be just fine. Will pool 2.5ul (or 3ul) to make a mini-library that we will shallow sequence to get reads/sample for calibrating the amount of 
DNA/RNA hybrid to add in the final pool for deep sequencing.
