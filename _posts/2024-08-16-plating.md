## 8/16/24 Plating RNA

Prior to Monday I have to put my RNA samples in 96 well plates for normalization and then transfer to the 384-well reaction plate. So that's what I did today...

Also having some more ammonia issues, so I am going to swing by the fish room to see what's up. If any are dangerously high, I will exchange. Otherwise, I'll wait until next week.
