## 7/3/24 Lawson and Boot RNA extractions

Continuing on with gill RNA extractions. Now I am finishing Lawson and moving onto Boot. I realized today that that DNA/RNA Shield that you do the digestion in is 2X. I had been treating as 1X. 
Seeing as how we've been getting good results, I am going to keep doing as is, as there is plenty of this reagent in each kit. Like, LOTS! 

Yestereday Diana, Andi, and I did liver dissections on two fish. Turns out we definitely weren't taking head kidney, so we are a go for doing extractions on the liver. My initial extractions showed 
that the liver were lower quality in terms of the spectral ratios, so we should probably send those for TapeStation to get RINs. On the gills too. 

Today I am also meeting with Dan Bolnick's former grad student, Grace Vaziri. She used the Alithea Mercurius BRB-seq kit, so it will be great to pick her brain about specifics.

I forgot to do the 1 min long spin for the final wash. Probably doesn't matter much, but potentially some EtOH contamination. Yields were crazy good today, with average of 350. One was even ~640 
ng/ul!

Have to run to the fish room to do water exchanges. High ammonia.
