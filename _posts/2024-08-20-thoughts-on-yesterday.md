## 8/20/24 Preparing for tomorrow and maybe fish room stuff?

Okay so I heard back from Clement regarding storage of the RT plate while we wait for shallow sequencing results. Apparently it can be stored at -20 for a few weeks, so that's good. Still I'm 
going to store it at 4C for today since I wan't to minimize freeze/thaw.

I also just wrote to Clement to get his take on our normalization approach. In a previous email they said they don't do that approach in 384 plates because it is "too complicated." I wonder why. 
Seems straightforward enough if you have a robot.

Also, I am going to ask him if we could just even volumes of water to the RT plate wells to help with normalizing the input into the pool. Much easier to aspirate 10ul than 2ul, for example. After 
taking 2.5ul there should be 7.5ul left, but we can't get all of that out. If we just add 5ul of water to each well, that should bring us to 12.5ul. Then we have essentially 10ul to play with, 
assuming 2.5ul of dead space.

Also, I may have to run to the fish room today to either kill fish to reduce densities or just do water exchanges. Waiting to hear from Diana.
