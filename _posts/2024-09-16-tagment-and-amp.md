## 9/16/24 Tagmentation and amplification of final pool

Today I'll tagment and amplify the final pool. I'll also see if I can have the finished library run on a TapeStation/BioAnalyzer at IGM before I send off to Davis this week. Hopefully they can do it 
by Tuesday so I can ship overnight on Wednesday. 

Last time I did 15 cycles of PCR b/c I didn't really care about duplicates (just using for normalization). This time I am going to do just 12, as the manual reccommends 11-12 if using the full 20ng. 
Hopefully we get enough yield. Good thing is that we have plenty of cDNA that we can return to if necessary.

Using the Jackrel Lab thermocycler (on the left) for the library amplification because Caitlin using ours for library preps.

5.64 ng/ul for the final pool! That should be plenty and this is with just 12 cycles of PCR too, so that's great.
