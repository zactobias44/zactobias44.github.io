## 9/16/24 Tagmentation and amplification of final pool

Today I'll tagment and amplify the final pool. I'll also see if I can have the finished library run on a TapeStation/BioAnalyzer at IGM before I send off to Davis this week. Hopefully they can do it 
by Tuesday so I can ship overnight on Wednesday.
