## 10/14/24 Last week update....again

So it looks like I forgot to write posts again last week. I did a lot I swear! The new BRBseq data was released early last week, so I put all of that up to Poseidon and used STARsolo to generate 
a count matrix. I pulled that down to Darwin and am now playing with the data. Lots of interesting tidbits are emerging! A lot more parallelism among the three species pair lakes than expected due 
to chance!

Also did step one of library prep for Caitlin last week.

Also working a lot on the mitotype stuff. I finally generated a tree, but the support was really crummy so a did an alignment just on the PCGs and did the tree again. Still crummy bootstrap support, 
but it corresponds with the first tree. Gonna pull out mitotypes and start making this map.
