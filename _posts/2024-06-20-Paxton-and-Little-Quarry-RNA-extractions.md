## Paxton and Little Quarry RNA extractions

So it turns out that one of the samples I was planing to extract today we don't have gills for (093, a benthic fenmale), so let's include the first of the samples that were going to be extracted 
tomorrow to even it 
out to 24. This means that we'll have 21 more to extract next. Wonder if we can balance that in the rotor...

Here is the new table with sample numbers by site and sex/ecotype.


|Population|Benthic Males|Benthic Females|Limnetic Males|Limnetic Females|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Little Quarry|10|10|9|10|
|Paxton|10|10|10|10|
|Priest|10|10|10|10
