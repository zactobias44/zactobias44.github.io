## 11/25/24 DNA extractions

Week of Thanksgiving. Came in during afternoon to do DNA extractions. It's 
been two months! I think I remember how to do it. 286-335. Stella, 
Merrill, and McCreight. Will come in tomorrow AM to finish extractions and 
then definitely need to go to fish room to do water exchanges.
