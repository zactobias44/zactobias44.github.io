## 9/19/24 DNA extractions and Qubitting

Tracking sample package. It has been received. I submitted the tube with a different label than the digital submission, so I edited the sample submission form online. JUst didn't want to transfer to 
a new tube and risk losing volume.

Today doing another 48 extractions. Mostly Lower Campbell, Bob, and Stella fish. ALso will Qubit those from yesterday.
