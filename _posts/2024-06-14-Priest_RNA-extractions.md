## Priest RNA extractions

Proceeded with a batch of 24 RNA extractions. 2024_DJR_003 to 026. 13 benthics and 11 limnetics. For the most part taking one gill or half gill per extraction. Large variability in gill size between 
ecotypes. Dabbing gill on kimwipe to remove excess RNAlater. Lots of precipitate in stored samples, and didn't seem to be frozen solid... Some samples had only small bit of tissue, so for those I 
took all of it, so there are some samples that we cannot re-do if something goes wrong...

Also, when homogenizing the tissue with the pestle, make sure to "plunge" up and down a bit at first to bring the sample off bottom of tube. Then forcefully twist pestle, ensuring contact between 
gill and side wall of tube. Homogenize to tiny bits. After 2 hour digestion in pK, these should be dissolved.
