## Priest RNA extractions

Proceeded with a batch of 24 RNA extractions. 2024_DJR_003 to 026. 13 benthics and 11 limnetics. For the most part taking one gill or half gill per extraction. Large variability in gill size between 
ecotypes. Dabbing gill on kimwipe to remove excess RNAlater. Lots of precipitate in stored samples, and didn't seem to be frozen solid... Some samples had only small bit of tissue, so for those I 
took all of it, so there are some samples that we cannot re-do if something goes wrong...

Also, when homogenizing the tissue with the pestle, make sure to "plunge" up and down a bit at first to bring the sample off bottom of tube. Then forcefully twist pestle, ensuring contact between 
gill and side wall of tube. Homogenize to tiny bits. After 2 hour digestion in pK, these should be dissolved. 

Note for future batches of 24. When making the digestion mix (RNA/DNA shield, pK, and pK buffer), make up a master mix with enough for 26 tubes. There is plenty of reagent for this. I did 25x this 
time and the last tube was all bubbles. Also, try just mixing by pipetting up and down instead of vortexing. Should make it easier. 

So the 26 sample MM should be:

* 5.2 ml DNA/RNA shield
* 260 ul proteinase K
* 520 ul pK digestion buffer

Use dispensing pipette to distribute 230 ul into each tube. And remember, ALWAYS USE FILTER TIPS!

About 1.5 hours into the digestion I agitated the tubes and notice that there was still some undigested tissue. Seemed to be mostly the cartilaginous bits, not the feathery vascularized tissue. 
Still, to ensure proper lysis, let's extend the digestion to 3+ hours. I have a meeting at 1 that will probably just go 30 min, so a 10:30-1:30 digestion will be an even 3 hours. Obviously, some of 
the lower numbered tubes will digest longer, because the timer started at the end of the last tube. No matter. 

When all was said and done, we got awesome yields. Mean of 142 ng/ul. Decent amount of variability though. Min=32.7 Max=357. Seems like the kit is working well. Next week we'll move on to finish up 
Priest gills and start on another population.
