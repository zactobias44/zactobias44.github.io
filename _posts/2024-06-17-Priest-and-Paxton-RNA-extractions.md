## Priest and Paxton RNA exractions

Finishing up Priest gill extrations and moving onto Paxton. I am going to try to select Priest samples such that I even out the sex ratio as best I can. I'll list the samples I am doing below.

So I have 13 of each Priest ecotype. 5 females and 8 males for each ecotype. Will try to get 5 more females and 2 more males for each ecotype.
