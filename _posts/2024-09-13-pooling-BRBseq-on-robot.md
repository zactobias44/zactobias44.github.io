## 9/13/24 Pooling BRB-seq on robot

Just real quick. I noticed that tip 6 (from top) was underpipetting on the addition of 4 ul on the fourt batch. So this should effect columns 19-24, rows K and L. This means that they are less 
dilute than the others and that these might end up getting more reads. Still hopefully will be more even than the first run.
