## 10/17/24 Library 5 and SNP calling

Did Caitlin's library 5 day 1. Same deal with 8min tagmentation and 0.7x bead clean. 

ALso, working on calling nuclear SNPs of the NCBI data with freebayes. Restricting analysis to the sites from David's combined vcf. Some two million SNPs. Will hopefully be able to merge these two 
multi-sample vcfs and then convert to a baypass format and do a GWAS with the mitotype. Just wanna make a damn Manhattan plot and get some preliminary results. 

Before I merge, I want to make sure all of the sites have the same alt allele.
