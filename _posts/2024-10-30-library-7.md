## 10/30/24 Library 7 and updates

Okay so I've been AWOL for a bit. Today I am going to do day one of Library 7 for Caitlin.

I've also been working on the gene expression data, particularly with this multiWGCNA package. ALso some GO_MWU stuff. Working on my PRFB propsosal, and now working on my WSN talk.

I am also getting involved in Sam Yeaman's Repeated Adaptation working group. I pitched a subproject using gene expression data, and Sam seems pretty down. I think it could be cool to head up a 
paper looking at repeatability/parallelism of gene expressino along a particular axis of divergence in multiple species of fish. Diana had a good idea of broadening out even further to look across 
axes and species to get at the general drivers of genex parallelism. Where genes are located, how pleiotropic they are, whether their gene sequence evolution might be constrained (dN/dS tests), 
stuff like that. Could be a really cool set of papers!
