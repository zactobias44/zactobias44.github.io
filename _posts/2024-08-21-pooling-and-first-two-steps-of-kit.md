## 8/21/24 Pooling and first two steps of kit

So I pooled over at JCVI. Took 3 ul of RT sample with multichannel and transferred to column of 96 well plate. First time we did with mixing but looked like a lot left in tip so switched to no mix. 
So this affects positions A1, C1, E1, etc. Just eight samples. Made a note in spreadsheet. Rest were jetted in and just a little bit left in tip (~0.25ul). Brought all stuff back to Muir. 

At Muir I pooled the 16 minipools together into one tube. Full volume was 1,150ul. We were expecting 1,312, so looks like we are ~0.42ul short from each well. That kinda checks out. 

Here I did the bead clean and just started the free primer digestion step. When making the EXO MM, I think I took 4.4ul of enzyme instead of buffer. So started over. Just means we may be 4.4ul short 
of enzyme, but they gave us 10ul and we only need 1.1ul for each time we do this, so we should be fine. 

Going to lunch now. EXO is incubating now on a 50 min program. When I return I will proceed to second strand synthesis and then do another bead clean and quantification. At that point it will be 
safe to store at -20 C until next week when I return. Then I'll do tagmentation and amplification.
