## 8/21/24 Pooling and first two steps of kit

So I pooled over at JCVI. Took 3 ul of RT sample with multichannel and transferred to column of 96 well plate. First time we did with mixing but looked like a lot left in tip so switched to no mix. 
So this affects positions A1, C1, E1, etc. Just eight samples. Made a note in spreadsheet. Rest were jetted in and just a little bit left in tip (~0.25ul). Brought all stuff back to Muir. 

At Muir I pooled the 16 minipools together into one tube. Full volume was 1,150ul. We were expecting 1,312, so looks like we are ~0.42ul short from each well. That kinda checks out. 

Here I did the bead clean and just started the free primer digestion step. When making the EXO MM, I think I took 4.4ul of enzyme instead of buffer. So started over. Just means we may be 4.4ul short 
of enzyme, but they gave us 10ul and we only need 1.1ul for each time we do this, so we should be fine. 

Going to lunch now. EXO is incubating now on a 50 min program. When I return I will proceed to second strand synthesis and then do another bead clean and quantification. At that point it will be 
safe to store at -20 C until next week when I return. Then I'll do tagmentation and amplification.  

After lunch, finished EXO and moved onto SSS. The tube got crumpled in the thermocycler, but I was able to salvage the pool, thank god. Using strip tubes now. 

Finished SSS now doing bead clean. Will Qubit shortly.

3.07 ng/ul! So we have 18 ul of cDNA left, that puts us at 55.26 ng. We can only use up to 15ul in the next step, so that's 46.05 ng. The maximum it wants is 20ng for tagmentation, so we just need 
to use 6.5 ul (19.955 ng). We'll add that to 4ul TAB, 3ul TE, and 6.5ul of water, for a 20ul rxn volume. 

I will start tagmentation on Tuesday!
