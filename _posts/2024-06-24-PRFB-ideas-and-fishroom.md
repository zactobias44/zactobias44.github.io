## PRFB ideas and fishroom orientation

We are still waiting on more pestles for tissue homogenization, so the RNA extractions are on hold until those arrive. In the meantime, I am doing some reading/thinking about ideas for a PRFB 
proposal. I've been interested in mitonuclear coevolution for a while (since reading some Ron Burton Tigriopus papers back in 2018), and I was thinking that this could make a good basis for a RoL 
PRFB proposal for the next cycle. It is my understanding that the PRFB proposal should diverge to some degree from the existing research in the host lab, and this is something that would be pretty 
brand new for the Rennison Lab. I talked to Diana about it last week, and she is behind me putting a proposal together on this theme. Still lot's of fleshing out to do, but I think it could be a 
really cool avenue of research. 

Apparently there are two very divergent mitochondrial lineges in the sticklelback, one called TNP (Trans-Northern Pacific) and another called ENA (Europe and North America). In the NEP, these are in 
contact with one another, where you get more TNP the more NE you go along the Pacific coast of NA, until you get to Kamchatka/Kuril Islands where it becomes mostly TNP. Turns out there are two lakes 
that are right next to each other on the Kenai Peninsula (Sportfishing and Barbara/Barabara) that are fixed for the alternative mitotypes. Lakes appear to be similar size and are literally right 
next to each other, so probably experience similar environmental conditions. I'm thinking this could be a really neat system. Make some crosses and backcrosses, put the mitochondrial lineages on 
different nuclear backgrounds, measure the fitness consequence (in terms of some physiological metric I think could be cool). Could also pair this with a range-wide genomics component to look for 
associations between nuclear and mitochondrial variation. THis has been done, but it used sparse RAD-seq which may have missed things (Lescak et al 2017), and they only used a small handful of pops. 
We may have a lot of these fish on hand and maybe even already sequenced some (though to zone where there are more or less 50/50 proportions of the two mitotypes is in Alaska, north of where most of 
our sampling is). 

Anyway, these are some of my early thoughts about a PRFB. I think it could fit into the RoL framework (geno,pheno,enviro). There are a few people who I think would be neat to collobrate on this, as 
I know that is another desirable component of a PRFB. William Cresko at U of O. Did a lot of the stickleback mitotype stuff. Patricia Schulte at UBC. Fish physiology. Eric Pavlovacs at UCSC. 
Apparently has done a lot of stickleback physiology as well. Once I have a better idea of what I am doing I should email these folks.
