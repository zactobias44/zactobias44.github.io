## 7/11/24 Stella and Merrill RNA extractions

Eight more stellas and sixteen Merrills. Will finish up Merrill (8 more) and Stella (8 more) tomorrow, and also add 8 McCreight.

Good yields. 

94 more extractions to go. That's 4 days. Can do Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Then I can work on Evolution talk Thursday and Friday, among other things. Those days the pipettes are getting 
calibrated anyway.
