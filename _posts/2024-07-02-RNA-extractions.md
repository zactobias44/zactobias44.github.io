## 7/2/24 More RNA extractions

Finishing off Ormund and Little Mud, and starting on Lawson.

Talked to Diana re: yesterday's idea. We are going to drop Roberts and proceed with sequencing the 383. Will make things much easier. 

Clement at Alithea recommends sequencing the BRB-seq libraries 28 nt for first read and 60-90 nt for second read. Never heard of this custom cycle number. I reached out to Davis' Core to see if this 
is possible. I mentioned that I want ~2 billion read pairs. We'll see what they say.

Also going to do a mock liver dissection today with Andi and Diana to see if we can separate head kidney from liver, and to assess what we actually took in the field.
