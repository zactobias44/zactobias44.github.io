## 11/26/24 Finish DNA extractions

Finishing the DNA extractions today. Not going to start more because tomorrow will be busy with THanksgiving prep. 

Also need to boil the RNAse A stock. Still figuring out how exactly, but I see stuff online that says 10-20 min at 95 C. Asking Caitlin and David.

OKay so finished up. It seemed like I may have lost some pellets onn the second batch. Putting straight in freezer instead of fridge o/n because I don't want to come in tomorrow to Qubit. Will do 
next week. Also offered to do day 1 of a library prep for Caitlin Wednesday.
