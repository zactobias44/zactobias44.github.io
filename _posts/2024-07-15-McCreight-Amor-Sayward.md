## 7/15/24 McCreight, Amor, and Sayward RNA extractions

More extractions today. Finishing up McCreight, extracting the 12 from Amor, skipping Roberts and starting on Sayward. One of the Stella extractions from Friday was pretty low (~21 ng/ul). May try 
a different sample or just use it all and rely on the read normalization from MiSeq nano run.
