## 8/13/24 Test RNA extraction w/ and w/o DNAse

So I grabbed a Lawson fish from the fish room this morning. Going to dissect two sets of gills and run parallel extractions, one w/ DNAse and the other w/o. I want to see how effective the DNAse 
treatment really is. If we still get some trace DNA in the DNAse treated extraction, I'm going to conclude that DNA contamination is common and that it likely won't matter. If we see that the DNAse 
treated one really does work, well then we might have to retreat all of our samples with DNAse...

Also going to split sample 407 into two and retreat with DNAse. I think I'll have to mix the purified RNA with EtOH to get it to bind to column. I'll read about it.

So what I ended up doing was just take 20 ul of sample 207 and start from the beginning, essentially just using that 20 ul of purified RNA as tissue. We'll see. We don't expect a band anyway so...

Running the PCR now and going to run this gel today as well. 

Okay so here is the pic of the gel. First column is ladder, then new extraction w/o DNAse, new extraction w/ DNAse (and wash), 407 original (positive control), and 407 repurified (w/ DNAse)

Well, we didn't get a band in the positive control... This one showed a band yesterday. This time I used 1.5 ul of the sample and no additional water, instead of 1 ul water and 0.5 sample. Thought 
that would be even brighter, but possible there's too much template?? I don't think so. 

Anyway, the only one that has any kind of band is the first sample lane, the new extraction w/o DNAse treatment. Looks like a big band (or a few) at the very top near the wells. This is probably 
gDNA. So it looks like the DNAse got rid of that in the other samples, even for ones that I forgot the wash step (lane 4, sample 407 original). 

Hmmmm. What can we conclude? Weird that we didn't get an inversion band in the second lane (or the positive control, for that matter).

I am inclined to just take a leap of faith and take Alithea's word for it that DNA contamination shouldn't matter. It must be so trace, even with the missing wash. I'll talk to Diana.
