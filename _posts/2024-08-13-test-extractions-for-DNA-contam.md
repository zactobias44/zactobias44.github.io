## 8/13/24 Test RNA extraction w/ and w/o DNAse

So I grabbed a Lawson fish from the fish room this morning. Going to dissect two sets of gills and run parallel extractions, one w/ DNAse and the other w/o. I want to see how effective the DNAse 
treatment really is. If we still get some trace DNA in the DNAse treated extraction, I'm going to conclude that DNA contamination is common and that it likely won't matter. If we see that the DNAse 
treated one really does work, well then we might have to retreat all of our samples with DNAse...

Also going to split sample 407 into two and retreat with DNAse. I think I'll have to mix the purified RNA with EtOH to get it to bind to column. I'll read about it.

So what I ended up doing was just take 20 ul of sample 207 and start from the beginning, essentially just using that 20 ul of purified RNA as tissue. We'll see. We don't expect a band anyway so...

Running the PCR now and going to run this gel today as well.
