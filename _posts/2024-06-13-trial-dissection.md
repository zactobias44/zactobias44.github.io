## Head kidney, liver, or both?

So while we were in the field it was really hard to disentangle the head kidney from the liver during our dissections. To me, it all just looked like pinkish goop near the anterior end of the 
abdominal cavity. So today Diana and I are going to dissect a fish or two and see if we can tease apart the head kidney and liver, to see what exactly we grabbed in the field. We'll then put in 
RNAlater, freeze, thaw, and see if we can disentangle them ex situ, to determine whether or not we can tease them apart from the stored samples we have. I am not optimistic it will be possible.

Chances are, we will have to just extract RNA from the whole mess of head kidney/liver. My worry is that some samples may just be one or the other, not both, so there could be big differences in 
expression that are due to source tissue. We will see!

Other happenings today: new postdoc orientation on Zoom from 9-11, so that's fun. If I have time hopefully I'll also start an RNA extraction, maybe on gill. I'm guessing because this tissue is so 
cartilaginous that I'll have to incubate for a long while. Gonna thaw a couple samples before the orientation.
