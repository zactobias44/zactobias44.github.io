## 9/5/24 Finish DNA extractions

Yesterday I started 001-024. Did both muscle and fin to compare yield. Went through the process today following the lab protocol. Pretty straightforward. During resuspension, I did the first four 
tubes but noticed there was still some ethanol in there after 45 minutes. Pushed to about 1 hour 5 minutes. Seemed to take care of residual ethanol. 

This afternoon I set up 48 extractions that I will finish tomorrow. Feel pretty confident I can handle two batches of 24. At this pace I should be done with all 384 in a total of 8 days. Not bad!

Also working on downloading all of the NCBI WGS stickleback data. Stay tuned!
