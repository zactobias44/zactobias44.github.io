## 9/4/24 First DNA extractions

Since finishng all of my fin clipping this morning, I figured I should start some DNA extractions, since I'm just waiting on sequencing results from IGM before I do any more RNA stuff.

Doing 2024-DJR-001 through 024. Trying both muscle and fin to see if there is a difference in yield. 400 ul of digestion buffer and 7 ul of pK. Made MM first in 15ml tube. 10.4 ml of buffer, 182 ul 
pK. Got a little foamy, but worked fine b/c plenty of spop (x26). 

Added tissue and then vortexed and put at 55 C. Will leave overnight (finished around 2:30 pm)
