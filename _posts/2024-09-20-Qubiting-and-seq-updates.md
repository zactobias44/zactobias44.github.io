Just Qubited the extractions from yesterday. Really good yields across the board. Will continue with extractions on Monday/Tuesday.

Also heard back from Siranoosh at Davis. Apparently we should be using the 150 cycle kit (PE75). The read length can be partitioned in any way across the two reads, so it will be perfect for 28+90. 
Woohoo! Save 600 (potentially 1,200) bucks.
