## 8/15/24 Third PCR

So the PCR from Tuesday essentially failed in that we didn't get any bands. Today I am re-doing it with the gDNA positive control. Also going back to just 0.5 ul of template instead of 1.5ul. 

So I'm doing BEAV#1 gDNA, new Lawson -DNAse, new Lawson +DNAse, orginal 407 -DNAse, new 407 +DNAse. That's the order in the gel.

Also, I Qubitted the RNA samples. 

|sample|ng/ul|
|Lawson -DNAse|600|
|Lawson +DNAse|540|
|original 407|653|
|407 +DNAse|227.5|

So lots of RNA all around. The original 407 was at 682, so there may be some loss or just quantifying/pipetting error. But comparing the repurified one, I took 20 out of 50ul, so I should expect to 
have 261 ng/ul. I have 227. So I retained the vast majority of RNA after repurification and DNAse treatment. So I suppose we could do this for all samples and not risk losing too much. Mind you, 
this was THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION sample. Might be different for lower yield samples?
