## 6/26/2024 Fin clipping and JCVI tour

Today still waiting on the pestles for RNA extractions, so just doing fin clips. Also met with Joanna to figure out how to place a PO for Alithea BRB-seq kit. 

Also going to run to JCVI to meet with Ariel and check out their robot and other 384-well infrastructure.
