## 6/26/2024 Fin clipping and JCVI tour

Today still waiting on the pestles for RNA extractions, so just doing fin clips. Also met with Joanna to figure out how to place a PO for Alithea BRB-seq kit. 

Also going to run to JCVI to meet with Ariel and check out their robot and other 384-well infrastructure.

Learned all about the pipetting robot. Eppendorf EcoPlus? We pretty much have everything we need. There is a tool that would be helpful for putting our samples from 1.5ml tubes into a 384 well 
plate. Or a 96-well plate. It's this width-adjustable pipettor that you can aspirate liquid from 1.ml tubes, and then narrow the tips to fit in 96 well. COuld be handy but needs special Rainin 300 
LTS tips. Could ask, or just manually add RNA into a 96-well plate, then have the robot transfer to a 384. 

NOw I am going to do some more fin clipping.
