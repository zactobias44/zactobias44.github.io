## First RNA extractions

Attempting the first RNA extractions with the Zymo RNA-quick miniprep plus kit. Prepared all of the buffers yesterday and RNAse-zapped the f out of everything: surfaces, pipettes, etc.

Proceeding with gill and liver tissue from two individuals, 2024_DJR_001 and 002. 300ul of storage buffer (DNA/RNA shield), 30 ul proteinase K buffer, and 15 ul proteinase K. Ground up with 
mini-pestles. It's possible that I lost the bit of tissue from 002 L. Couldn't locate halfway through homogenization. Maybe it just dissolved? Or maybe I forgot to add tissue... We'll see with RNA 
yield. Going to let sit for a number of hours at RT and see what happens. The tubes look pretty well digested already, but could be a good bet to come in AM to homogenize, let sit for a few hours, 
and then process rest of extractions in PM. 

May want to consider homogenizing in smaller volume (maybe 50 or 100 ul) and then top up to 300 ul. I remember doing this with crab neural tissue in PhD lab. The tissue kind of dances around and can 
get missed by the pestle if in too large of a volume.

Okay making some adjustments to the protocol.

Turns out that 300ul is too much for initial volume, because once you add equal volume of lysis buffer and then an equal volume of EtOH to that, you have too much volume for the column and I don't 
want to run it through twice. Let's do it in 200ul.

200 ul RNA/DNA Shield
10 ul proteinase K
20 ul proteinase K buffer

Digest for 2 hours at RT after mechanical homogenization with pestle (especially for gill)

Add 230 ul of RNA Lysis Buffer

Spin through Spin-Away Column (yellow) and KEEP THE FLOW THROUGH

Mix flowthrough with 460 ul of 100% EtOH.

Pass through Zymo-SPin IIICG Column (green)

Discard flow through!

Mix n x 5 ul x 1.05 DNAse and n x 75 ul x 1.05 DNA digestion buffer.

Add 80 ul of mix to each column. Incubate for 15 min at RT. 

Wash with 400 ul of RNA prep buffer

Wash with 700 ul RNA wash buffer

Wash with another 400 ul RNA wash buffer. SPin for 1 min

Elute in 50 ul of nuclease free water

Quantify with Qubit BR RNA kit.
