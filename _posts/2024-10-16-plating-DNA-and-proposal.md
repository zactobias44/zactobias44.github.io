## 10/16/24 Plating DNA and proposal work

So yesterday I spent pretty much the whole day data wrangling and making a plot of mitotypes. Map looks great but goddam you gotta be more efficient with your time....

Anyway, today I am going to plate DNA for tomorrow's library 5 part one. Then I'll work on incoporating Carolyn and Diana's comments on the proposal. Really want to get this project description done 
this week so I can start on making the figures and finish the other documents. 

Another thing I'd like to do is do a "quick" GWAS with mitotype as the trait. I have all of the NCBI nuclear bams on Poseidon (mapped with bbmap), and I can snag all of the Rennison lab bams (mapped 
with bwa...) and scp up to Poseidon. Just need to dedup with Picard and then call SNPs with freebayes. Hopefully wouldn't take too long.... Then do a baypass.
