## 10/16/24 Plating DNA and proposal work

So yesterday I spent pretty much the whole day data wrangling and making a plot of mitotypes. Map looks great but goddam you gotta be more efficient with your time....

Anyway, today I am going to plate DNA for tomorrow's library 5 part one. Then I'll work on incoporating Carolyn and Diana's comments on the proposal. Really want to get this project description done 
this week so I can start on making the figures and finish the other documents.
