## 7/21/24 RNA extractions Ormund, Little Mud, Lawson

So after talking with Diana, we are just going to stick with gill for now. Because we want to sequence 240 samples in one lane of NovaSeq X (for 5M reads/sample), we are going to include Vancouver 
Island pops in this first batch. We are going to include the populations that have fewer than 20 individuals (12 each from Roberts, Amor, and Campbell River). This makes 15 pops (12 lake, 3 
marine). Because we already have 119 from the species pair lakes, we want ~121 individuals from Vancouver. I'm extracting 8 samples per 15 pops, for 120. With 239 samples for this first batch of 
BRB-seq and sequencing, we should get around that 5M reads/sample level. 

If we sequence a full 20 from the 12 pops with at least that number, and then the remaining 4 from the sites with 12, we'll have 156 left to sequence. So will these just have much higher "coverage", 
or should we include other samples in that sequencing run to soak up some reads. Alternatively, we could maybe fit all of them in one run and then sequence on a higher capacity flow cell? Lemme 
think about this for a sec.
