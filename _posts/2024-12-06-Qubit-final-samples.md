## 12/6/24 Qubit final samples and plate?

So I just finished Qubitting all of the final samples and rextractions. Great across the board. Ready now to plate. Will chat with Diana first about whether or not we want to include Dolph's samples 
in any pools or just pool by plate (96 individuals per pool). Could be too high of coverage? But could be nice to do Dolph's separately and add any re-preps we want to do from Caitlin's stuff and do 
in the new year, rather than rushing to get it all done. I looked at my schedule and I don't think it's possible to do 5 preps in the time before the holiday. 4 is maybe doable and could get 
TapeStation done on the final Thursday, get results hopefully Friday and then submit Monday the 23rd. That's if Novogene accepts samples that close to XMas...

So yeah otherwise just working on the proposal and going to seminar today. Oh yeah and plating if I get the go-ahead. The reason I need to wait to plate is that I need to figure out whether to 
include Dolph's samples in the randomized plates or proceed separately.
