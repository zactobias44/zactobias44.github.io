## 9/12/24

Just qubitting the past two days of extractions. Did the first batch of 48 from the 10th already. Look mostly good. Will do next 48 after lunch.

Started out the day at the fish room to do water exchanges because of high ammonia. Andi did half of them yesterday. I got through all of them except tank 93 b/c the reservoir was low. Will do 
later. This had low ammonia anyway. Should move fish to recirc soon. Also saw two tanks (92 and 84?) that had more fish than the labels said. I am worried that maybe fish got moved around? Hopefully 
I just undercounted when I first censused...

Also going to play with STAR today with the MiSeq Nano data. Trying to boost the mapping rate and also hope to figure out why it's not detecting my barcodes...
