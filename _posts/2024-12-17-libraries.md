## 12/17/24 WGS libraries

Been making the BC libraries and helping with Caitlin's. We switched to SPRI beads which really seems to boost the yields. No apparent difference in the TapeStation results though.

The plan is to submit one BC pool (one plate of 96) with Caitlin's stuff. Then we'll get a sense of if 96 per lane results in the ideal depth of coverage (we want 20x). I'm just making the remaining 
libraries, though, so we can just submit right away in the new year, figuring how much to pool given the results of the first pool.

Sooooo on the PCR step I didn't realize that there was a 98 hold (hot start) on the program. So I just plopped the plate in there and hit run, returned 25 min later to see it had been at 98 all that 
time. Not sure if everything is boiled to oblivion, but I just proceeded with the prep. I'll quantify tomorrow or Thursday, so that should tell me something. But I should definitely TapeStation a 
few libraries before pooling. I wasn't planning on pooling until we get the seq data back for Pool A, so that's no biggie. I hope I didn't just throw ~$2.5K down the drain...
