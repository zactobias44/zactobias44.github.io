## Hello world

I've done it. Finally made a personal website (of sorts). The idea here is to have a place where I can take notes, discuss ideas, post cool pictures, and just 
generally muse on what I am up to on my scientific journey. 

After finishing my PhD in the MIT-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in early April, I moved to San Diego and started a postdoc in the Rennison Lab at UCSD. 
Here I'll be doing all sorts of neat work studying evolutionary parallelism in the threespine stickleback. Jumping the invertebrate ship into the wonderful world 
of fish! I started on May 1st, 2024, and within a few days I was on a plane to Seattle en route to Vancouver Island to collect stickleback! I was there for 11 
days -- and what an amazing 11 days it was. Romping around in big trucks on logging roads, wading in lakes, setting minnow traps, and hauling in gobs of 
stickleback (well, usually). Went there with a great team of four guys: myself, Andi, Josh, and David. Stayed in a rustic cabin on Roberts Lake. Worked 13-14 
hour days but they were always wrapped up with a Canadian old-fashioned (sub the simple syrup for maple, yum). 

In all we processed around 450 fish, covering 12 lakes and 3 marine populations. We were sampling gill and liver for gene expression, gut for microbiome stuff, 
and muscle for stable isotopes. Shot for 22 fish per lake, which we got with the exception of Amor and Roberts, and the Campbell River marine pop. Andi had just 
come from Texada and Nelson Islands where the species pair lakes are, so in total we have something like 550 fish to look at. Successful trip! Add to that some 
lake-lake, marine-marine, and lake-marine crosses. In vitro fertilization is really not that hard in stickleback, but it was my first time doing it so I was a 
bit nervous. They mostly turned out okay (eith the exception of crosses between Bob and Sayward)! Bob has really tiny females, so it was hard to get enough eggs. 
They also weren't quite as ready as some of the other populations. But we weren't even sure if we'd get any gravid females, especially from the marine 
populations which are supposed to go a bit later.

Highlights of the trip? Obviously getting to do great science was a plus, but getting to know the three guys on my trip was the best part. What an awesome 
introduction to the lab. Also, we got to see the northern lights! Honestly, they look a lot "poppier" in the photos, but it was still amazing to see. 

I'll write another blog post soon on what I've been up to since returning from that trip. For now, enjoy these pics of our field trip.
