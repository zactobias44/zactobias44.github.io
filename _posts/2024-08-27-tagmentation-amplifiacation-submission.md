## 8/27/24 Tagmentation, amplification, and submission

We left off with cDNA last week. Now the first step is to tagment. Proceeded as according to manual.

For library amplification, I chose the default 15 cyles even though I had 20ng of input tagmented cDNA. Could be overamplified (PCR duplicates), but because I am not actually using this for the real 
data, it 
shouldn't matter. We don't have the ability to do qPCR in the lab, so I can't determine optimal number of cycles. There is a table that says 11-12 for 20ng of input, so maybe we'll go with that for 
the final pool.

Anyway, the pool just finished it's 15 cycles in the thermocycler. Don't have the time to finish clean-up before lab lunch. Will let sit at 4 C in the block and proceed after lunch. 

Called IGM. They want 10 nM of library in 20ul. Assumning a peak at 550 (which is halfway between the 400-700 in the manual), that is 3.388 ng/ul. Should be more than doable. I can submit in one of 
our regular 1.5mL tubes instead of one of their fancy ones. Sample drop off today is 2-4pm, so will do on my way home. They will run tapestation first to see fragment size distribution. If it's far 
off, I can submit a new pool for sequencing because hopefully we will have a bunch left over.  

When I was doing the second clean up of the amplified library, I added the 35ul of beads to the 20ul of library before adding 30ul of water to bring to 50. I added the 30ul of water, but am worried 
that the ordering messed stuff up. I guess we'll find out when they run the Tape Station. Hopefully this part is not as sensitive since it's just the shallow seq. And because it was the second clean 
up? Hopefully most of the primer dimer was gone already. Dang. Since we still have cDNA from the SSS step, if I did mess up this purification I can always retagment and amplify. Just have to make 
sure we have enough reagents.

Qubit! 11.1 ng/ul!

Have to dilute to 3.388 ng/ul in 20ul, so I'll add 6.1 ul of sample and 13.9 ul of water. 

Going to email the manifests to IGM and then run this tube over there.
