## 7/21/24 RNA extractions Ormund and Little Mud

So after talking with Diana, we are just going to stick with gill for now. Because we want to sequence 240 samples in one lane of NovaSeq X (for 5M reads/sample), we are going to include Vancouver 
Island pops in this first batch. We are going to include the populations that have fewer than 20 individuals (12 each from Roberts, Amor, and Campbell River). This makes 15 pops (12 lake, 3 
marine). Because we already have 119 from the species pair lakes, we want ~121 individuals from Vancouver. I'm extracting 8 samples per 15 pops, for 120. With 239 samples for this first batch of 
BRB-seq and sequencing, we should get around that 5M reads/sample level. 

If we sequence a full 20 from the 12 pops with at least that number, and then the remaining 4 from the sites with 12, we'll have 156 left to sequence. So will these just have much higher "coverage", 
or should we include other samples in that sequencing run to soak up some reads. Alternatively, we could maybe fit all of them in one run and then sequence on a higher capacity flow cell? Lemme 
think about this for a sec. 

OKay new plan. If we drop one of the lake pops with 12 (Roberts or Amor), the 119 from species pair lakes, and then 20 each of the remaining Vancouver Island pops (except 12 for Campbell River and 
Roberts/Amor), brings us to 383, just shy of 384 of the reaction plate. Maybe good to have a negative control? Or just add an individual from a pop. This would be really nice because we would 
elimate batch effects. Down side is that we were aiming for 240 for sequencing to give us 1.2 billion reads for 5M reads/sample. So we need to beef up the sequencing power. I'm going to ask Davis 
what they recommend, if they can do single read in higher power kit. Website shows just paired end for higher volume. I'm also asking Clement at Alithea to see what read length they recommend. If we 
want 5M reads/sample with 384 samples, we need just under 2 billion reads. We could maybe just split the library across replicate lanes and get 2.4 billion reads. That'd be 1,400 x 2 = $2,800. Not 
too crazy. We'll see. I'll talk to Diana. If we want to do liver we can just use the same strategy. Won't need to worry about batch effects because it's a totally different tissue.

For now, I am just going to press on with extracting 20 gills per pop. So today is Ormund and Little Mud. 131-155, skipping 150 because it has a note saying "low biomass"
