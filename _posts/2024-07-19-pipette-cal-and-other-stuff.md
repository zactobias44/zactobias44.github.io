## 7/19/24 Pipette calibration and other stuff

Today the pipettes are being calibrated, so no lab work today. I'll start again tomorrow to finish of the Black Creek, Campbell River, pick a new Stella to make up for the low yield one, and throw 
in an extra Amor to make it 13. That will bring us to a total of 384. 

Today I am also working on my Evolution talk. I am also planning for putting the RNA in 96-well plates for normalization and then for transfer to 384. We'll have four 96 well plates, which we'll do 
the normalizations in. The lowest concentration sample (if all goes well tomorrow), is 32.7 ng/ul. We have samples that are over 600 ng/ul, so if we plate 10ul from each tube, we will have to 
add up to ~185 ul. So 96-well plates are essential for this. Once the plates are normalized, we will have the robot pipette 7 ul (228.9 ng) into the 384-well reaction plate. Then it's off to the 
races! 

One thing I am wondering is if the robot is smart enough to change the tool depending on the volume of water to be added to each tube. There's a lot of variation in concentration, so for some it 
will need a P10 and others a P200. I am also wondering how long this is going to take. Could take a long while if it needs to be switching tools constantly. Hopefully there is time to do the RT and 
pooling in the same day because I don't want to have to transport these normalization plates with some wells so full...
