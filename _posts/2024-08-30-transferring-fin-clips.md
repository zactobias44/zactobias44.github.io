## 8/30/24 Transferring fin clips, meeting with Jesse Weber, meeting with Diana

Looking for some random lab work to do in the morning, so I transferred the parental fin clips from Vancouver into screw cap tubes. Still need to take fin clips/muscle from the Texada/Nelson fish.

Also met with Jesse Weber at UWisc Madison to talk about my mito proposal. See notes for details, but the takeway is that he is totally cool with me pursuing my ideas and we don't really step on 
each others toes at all. Ongoing work in the Kenai and connections to UAA. Working on longevity proposal that may open up opportunity for further collaboration on mito stuff.

There was some back and forth yesterday with IGM on the run configuration. Wondering if we should do as instructed in the Mercurius manual or 150PE. I figured 150PE would be fine, just have to trim 
read 1, but I wrote to Clement and he wrote back saying we should just do the specified configuation, even though it's just for normalization. Sounds good to me.
