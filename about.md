Hi! I'm Zac Tobias. Currently (6/2024), I am a postdoc in the Rennison Lab in the Ecology, Behavior & Evolution department at University of California, San Diego. I'm broadly interested in 
understanding the genomic and physiological mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation to novel environments. To do so, I use biological invasions and natural colonization processes in taxa 
ranging from invertebrates to fish. 

A bit about my scientific past. Growing up in San Diego, I had long been fascinated by marine life, spending hours at the beach tidepooling, digging for sandcrabs, and fishing in Mission Bay. FILL 
IN HERE! As a senior at LC, I began researching the development of the zebrafish nervous system in the Weissman-Unni Lab. We also used the 
zebrafish as a model for understanding neurodegenerative disease. After graduating in 2012, I became a lab tech/manager in the same lab, where I was responsible for zebrafish husbandry, training 
undergrads, and research. In 2013 I also became the microscopy coordinator for the new microscopy core at LC, including a laser-scanning confocal microscope. While I enjoyed research in zebrafish, 
I really was itching to take the molecular skills I had learned and apply them to systems with more of a natural history component. 

In 2015 I left Portland, Oregon to start a masters program in ecological and evolutionary parasitology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand in the lab of Robert Poulin. I did a masters 
by thesis only, where I spent just one year conducting comparative phylogeography projects in two host parasite systems on the South Island.
