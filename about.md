Hi! I'm Zac Tobias. Currently (6/2024), I am a postdoc in the Rennison Lab in the Ecology, Behavior & Evolution department at University of California, San Diego. I'm broadly interested in 
understanding the genomic and physiological mechanisms underlying evolutionary adaptation to novel environments. To do so, I use biological invasions and natural colonization processes in taxa 
ranging from invertebrates to fish. 

A bit about my scientific past. Growing up in San Diego, I had long been fascinated by marine life, spending hours at the beach tidepooling, digging for sandcrabs, and fishing in Baja or Mission 
Bay. In 2011 I was lucky enough to land an REU at Sripps Institution of Oceanography, where I worked with Jules Jaffe. There I worked with an image classifier to identify different species of 
zooplankton. I also had the opportunity to do a six-day research cruise in the Southern California Bight.

 As a senior at LC, I began researching the development of the zebrafish nervous system in the Weissman-Unni Lab. We also used the zebrafish as a model for understanding neurodegenerative disease. After graduating in 2012, I became a lab tech/manager in the same lab, where I was responsible for zebrafish husbandry, training 
undergrads, and research. In 2013 I also became the microscopy coordinator for the new microscopy core at LC, including a laser-scanning confocal microscope. While I enjoyed research in zebrafish, 
I really was itching to take the molecular skills I had learned and apply them to systems with more of a natural history component. 

In 2015 I left Portland, Oregon to start a masters program in ecological and evolutionary parasitology at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand in the lab of Robert Poulin. I did a masters 
by thesis only, where I spent just one year conducting comparative phylogeography projects in two host parasite systems on the South Island. After returning to the US, I volunteered in the Funk Lab 
at Colorado State University, where I also had the opportunity to audit a Distributed Graduate Seminar course on landscape genetics. As part of this course I worked on a landscape genetics project 
in the Arizona treefrog, Dryophytes wrightorum. In the meantime, I took classes at Front Range Community College to do some prerequisites for PhD programs and also worked various jobs from breakfast 
cook to seasonal conservation jobs in Larimer County Department of Natural Resources.

In June of 2018 I started my PhD in the MIT-Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in the lab of Carolyn Tepolt. I worked on a couple of different projects early on, but eventually 
settled 
on my dissertation topic of genomic and ecophysiological adaptation to temperature in the invasive golden star tunciate, Botryllus schlosseri. My PhD provided me the opportunity to do a bunch of 
field work, hone my molecular skills, develop physiologial assays, and learn how to do bioinformatic analyses. Most importantly, it allowed me to really own my research and develop my own projects. 
I got a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship starting in the third year of my PhD, which gave me even more flexibility in directing my own research. I was successful 
in attracting funding from a variety of sources, including internal WHOI grants as well as funding from the American Philosophical Society. In 2023, a proposal I led the writing on was funded by the 
North Pacific Research Board, allowing us to expand our investigations to the west coast of North America. I defended my PhD in early April 2024 and promptly moved to San Diego in mid-April to start 
my postdoc on May 1st. 

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my wife and two kiddos, Max and Murphy. I also enjoy cooking and going fishing in the lakes and bays around San Diego. I love to travel, though it's tough 
with two kids in tow. I love being back in my hometown close to friends and family.
